- The project is an iPhone app which looks like Wechat Moments page. 
- The page consists of profile image, avatar and tweets list
- For each tweet, there will be a sender, optional content, optional images and comments
- A tweet contains from 0 to 9 images
- Pulling down table view to refresh, only first 5 items are shown after refreshing
- All tweets are fetched and stored in memory at the first time and only show first 5 of them at the beginning and after refresh.
- Show 5 more while user pulling up the view at the bottom of the table view.
- Supports layout on all kinds of iOS device screen and orientation.
- This is a static page.

#### Tech requirements:

- The data JSON will be hosted at localhost:2727
- An example of the response in `WeChatMomentsTests/Resources/Tweet.json` 
- Layout using storyboards or programmatically
- AutoLayout & Size Classes is appreciated.
- Unit tests are appreciated.
- Functional programming is appreciated
- Utilise GCD for multi-thread operation
- Only binary, framework or Cocopods dependency is allowed. do not copy other developer's source code(`*.h`, `*.m`, `*.swift`) into your project
- Keep your code clean as much as possible Production and Technical requirements are weighing equally in the final result.
